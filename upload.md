## Upload Manifest
<video id="video" controls preload="metadata" width="100%">
   <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/videos/uploadmanifest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## Upload Images (creates IIIF derivatives + manifest)

<video id="video" controls preload="metadata" width="100%">
   <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/videos/uploadimages.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

# Tips
* All uploaded images and manifests will get added the list on the main page.
* You do not have to stay on the upload success page. The image and manifests can take a minute to become avaliable. That page is doing a check. If you want to navigate away from that page you can.
