# Tips
* Read Only access to a workspace only works when you are logged in with a organization account. If you aren't sure if you are logged in via an GitHub organization account, the answer is you probably aren't.
* Read Only gives the same access as Read/Write if you are logged in with a GitHub user account.
* When creating a new workspace, wait a minute before switching. If after you get a switch error you are still unable to switch to the new workspace, [contact us](https://github.com/annonatate/annonatate/issues/new).
