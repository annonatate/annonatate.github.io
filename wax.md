This functionality is not avaliable in Annonatate yet. It is being worked on. I am updating the documentation as I am writing the code. This currently does not work.

# How to Integrate Wax
1. Go to [https://github.com/minicomp/wax](https://github.com/minicomp/wax)
2. Fork or click on "use this template button"
3. [Enable GitHub pages on your site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
4. If you fork, edit the description (gear icon next to About heading) to include "annonatate-wax", this is very important
5. If you use the template, "annonatate-wax" to the description field before you "create a repository from template"
6. Go to [annonatate.herokuapp.com/profile](annonatate.herokuapp.com/profile)
7. Under workspaces switch to the Wax workspace **This will not work, for Wax to work with Annonatate, we have to write some files, this does that.**
8. Wait a minute
9. Try switching again. It should work. Please let use know if it doesn't.


# How to Process a Collection
1. Once you are in the Wax workspace, go to the upload tab
2.
