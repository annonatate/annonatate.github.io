There is a dropdown of purposes. They don't currenlty do much, but in the future they could be used to differentiate the view of the annotation.
By default `commenting` is the choosen "purpose" and should cover most things. A list of each purpose from the dropdown is listed below with a corresponding description.


Definitions come from: [https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivation-and-purpose).

* **assessing**: The motivation for when the user intends to assess the target resource in some way, rather than simply make a comment about it. For example to write a review or assessment of a book, assess the quality of a dataset, or provide an assessment of a student's work.
* **bookmarking**: The motivation for when the user intends to create a bookmark to the Target or part thereof. For example an Annotation that bookmarks the point in a text where the reader finished reading.
* **classifying**: The motivation for when the user intends to classify the Target as something. For example to classify an image as a portrait.
* **commenting**: The motivation for when the user intends to comment about the Target. For example to provide a commentary about a particular PDF document.
* **describing**: The motivation for when the user intends to describe the Target, as opposed to (for example) a comment about it. For example describing the above PDF's contents, rather than commenting on their accuracy.
* **editing**: The motivation for when the user intends to request a change or edit to the Target resource. For example an Annotation that requests a typo to be corrected.
* **highlighting**: The motivation for when the user intends to highlight the Target resource or segment of it. For example to draw attention to the selected text that the annotator disagrees with.
* **identifying**: The motivation for when the user intends to assign an identity to the Target. For example to associate the IRI that identifies a city with a mention of the city in a web page.
* **linking**: The motivation for when the user intends to link to a resource related to the Target.
* **moderating**: The motivation for when the user intends to assign some value or quality to the Target. For example annotating an Annotation to moderate it up in a trust network or threaded discussion.
* **questioning**: The motivation for when the user intends to ask a question about the Target. For example to ask for assistance with a particular section of text, or question its veracity.
* **replying**: The motivation for when the user intends to reply to a previous statement, either an Annotation or another resource. For example providing the assistance requested in the above.
