# Create a custom view for external manifest or annotation
1. Navigate to [tag builder page](https://annonatate.fly.dev/annonaview). This page is linked on the [custom views page](https://annonatate.fly.dev/customviews) in the link `Start building custom views!`
2. Enter the manifest or annotation, choose the view type.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customview-12.png){:class="helpimage"}
3.  Update the viewer to reflect how you want the viewer to look, update the filename and save.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customview-13.png){:class="helpimage"}

7. All custom views are saved the the [custom view page](https://annonatate.fly.dev/customviews). After the view is done rendering the page will automatically update.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customview-6.png){:class="helpimage"}

8. After the custom view is done building you can open the url in a new browser (see next step) or edit the view. These pages can be easily embeded into another webpage with an iframe.
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customview-7.png){:class="helpimage"}

9. Custom view in browser
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/customview-8.png){:class="helpimage"}

#  Tips
* You do not have to wait on a page for the URL to load. You can go create annotations, collections etc and come back the page.
* If you don't plan on adding additional setting to your view, you do not need to create a custom view. Each annotation has a permanent URL that will display your annotation as a storyboard or image view. It can be found under the share button.

* You can also create custom views in [Annona's tag builder](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/annona/tools/#/tag-builder), but you will not be able to save these views to your workspace, however there is a permanent display URL that gets rendered.
