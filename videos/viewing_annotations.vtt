00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Click on Annotations tab.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.000
Immediately after creating the annotations the annotation will take a minute to render a url.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
By default the annotations will be grouped by image. If you toggle single annotation the annotations will each get their own record and URL.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:25.000
You can also view the annotations in an interactive storyboard view. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
When the annotations are grouped by image there will be one storyboard for each annotated image.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You can also search your annotations by keyword or facets in the sideboard.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.110
Each single annotation includes a link to the annotation grouped by image view.
