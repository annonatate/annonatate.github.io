# Tips
* You do not have to wait on a page for the URL to load. You can go create annotations, collections etc and come back the page.
* When building any type of storyboard custom view the fullpage setting is recommended. It is also recommended to wait until right before you save your custom view to select it because it will continually pop up with every new setting you enable.
* If you don't plan on adding additional setting to your view, you do not need to create a custom view. Each annotation has a permanent URL that will display your annotation as a storyboard or image view. It looks like the image below.
![Display URL for: Storyboard | Image View]({{site.baseurl}}/displayurl.png)
* You can also create custom views in [Annona's tag builder](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/annona/tools/#/tag-builder), but you will not be able to save these views to your workspace, however there is a permanent display URL that gets rendered.
