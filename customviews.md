# {{page.title}} walkthrough

<video id="video" controls preload="metadata" width="100%">
   <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/videos/customviews.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

# Tips
* You do not have to wait on a page for the URL to load. You can go create annotations, collections etc and come back the page.
* When building any type of storyboard custom view the fullpage setting is recommended. It is also recommended to wait until right before you save your custom view to select it because it will continually pop up with every new setting you enable.
