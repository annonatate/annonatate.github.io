5. If you set up a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) you can create more fine grained user permissions (read, write, admin). If you are using a personal account you can only grant write access.
