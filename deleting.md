# Deleting uploads (manifests/images)
**If you have read only access you will not be able to delete anything**
1. Go to home page.
2. Under the My Images tab click on the edit icon
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/deleting-1.png){:class="helpimage"}
3. A delete icon will appear next to items you have uploaded. Click the delete button. When the image is successfully deleted the image will disappear. 
Tips
*  If you have admin access you can delete anything, if you don't you can only delete uploads you have created.
